I dedicate a part of my time to help beginners finding a way in the wild world of programming, or other<br>
developer to learn a new skill. As such I am very proud of the work my friends [@drawbu](https://github.com/drawbu/),
[@vedsaga](https://github.com/Vedsaga/) &<br>
[@reyfey](https://github.com/Reyfey/) have been able to do with our hours of knowledge sharing.

I am currently a student at Fulbert’s high school, (2nd year after Baccalaureate) where I learn 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps/).
Planning for another 3 year of studying before searching for a Job as a 
[Front-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) or 
[FullStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full_stack) developer.

Currently, my biggest project is [Pincer](https://pincer.dev), a library I created to learn more about 
[websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and
[discord API](https://discord.dev) that has received contribution from 
[amazing people](https://github.com/Pincer-org/Pincer/graphs/contributors). It had been a key project to teach
me open-source organisation and way more has been done than i could ever imagine.

I have contributed to `152` repositories, opened `188` pull requests & `74` issues!
