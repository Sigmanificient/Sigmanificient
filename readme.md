# Hi!

My name is Yohann Boniface, I’m 19 a French student learning Full Stack Web Development, and a Pythonista.<br> 
Started Coding by age of 15 with the python programming language, my passion for design brought me to the website creation. 

I enjoy learning new things to become a better developer, always improving my code and my workflow.<br>
I believe in Open-source and use Arch-Linux as my current operating system.


Know more about myself by visiting my website or taking a look over my repositories and projects.

I dedicate a part of my time to help beginners finding a way in the wild world of programming, or other<br>
developer to learn a new skill. As such I am very proud of the work my friends @drawbu, @vedsaga &<br>
@reyfey have been able to do with our hours of knowledge sharing.

I am currently a student at Fulbert’s high school, (2nd year after Baccalaureate) where I learn DevOps.<br>
Planning for another 3 year of studying before searching for a Job as a Front-End or FullStack developer.

Currently, my biggest project is Pincer, a library I created to learn more about websocket and<br>
discord API that has received contribution from amazing people. It had been a key project to teach<br>
me open-source organisation and way more has been done than i could ever imagine.
